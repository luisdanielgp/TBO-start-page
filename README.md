# Simple custom start page

## Glitch demo [here](https://thebadoctopus-start-page.glitch.me/).   
Feedback would be very appreciated!!

## User stories:

- I can see the current time.
- I can search online from the start page.
- I have my most common sites for quick access.
- I can access to my own website from it.

## Code

The whole js/script.js file is commented in order to explain what I did in every line. Intended for new developers struggling while finding the relation and interaction between plain JavaScript and html/css.

I used bootstrap for the styling.

# What did I use?

Not so much was needed for coding this site:
- Atom text editor.
- Atom-live-server plugin for running it locally.
- Google Chrome, specially Chrome's console for debugging everytime my code didn't work.
- glitch.com for uploading my files once it was finished locally.

# Finally

Feel free to take the code and customize it with your own sites, logo, search, engine, background, colors. I mean, strip it down and re-build it if you wish. It's super simple but represented a challenge for me as a beginner. It's useful for practicing basic concepts.

### Thanks for reading.
